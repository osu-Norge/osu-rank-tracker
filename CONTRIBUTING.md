# Contributing

## Before making a contribution

* Take a look over at the [issues](https://github.com/osu-Norge/osu-rank-tracker/issues) tab.
* If what you're planning to do is not listed, make an issue and ask about whether or not the feature you want to add is needed *before* making a pull request.

## Code guidelines

* Code should meet the PEP8 standard, however with 120 characters as the max length per line instead of 80.
* Use single `'` quotes unless it's necessary to use double quotation marks `"`.
* Use double quotation marks `"` for multi-line comments.
* Variable names should be written in snake_case.

It is preferred that you also consider the following, however it is not required:

* Use embeds. Default embed color should be set to `ctx.me.color` unless there's a reason to use another color.
* All messages sent by the bot should be in norwegian.
* Variable names should be in english. The exception to this is if the variable name is visible to the end user. If this is the case, it should (preferably) be a norwegian name. An example of this are command args.
